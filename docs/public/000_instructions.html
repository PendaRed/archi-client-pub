<p>
    Edit your design.json to add services, components, databases and dataflows.

    You can mouse over a service to see a very short tool tip, or click on a service to see a web page dedicated to that service.
    You can use the data-flow dropdown to display the dataflows.  When you select one you get that dataflow web page.
    You can hover over the arrow in the data flow to see a tool tip for it, or click on the arrow to see the dataflow
    web page again.

    It supports a simple z-ordering with 1 being the top and 2 being behind it etc.  Services are drawn back to front,
    and dataflows are always drawn between z-order 2 and 1.
